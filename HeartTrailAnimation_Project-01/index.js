=> Summary of Working Mechanism:
1) When the mouse moves, the script detects its position (offsetX and offsetY).
2) It creates a new <span> element at the mouse pointer position.
3) The <span> element is given a random size.
4) The <span> element is added to the <body>, creating a visible effect.
5) After 3 seconds, the <span> element is removed to prevent clutter.
